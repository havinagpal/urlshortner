Thought for 1 second### Beginner-Friendly Installation Guide for Your Link Shortener

Let me walk you through setting up your link shortener on shared hosting, step by step, with no technical experience required:

## 1. Setting Up Your Database

### Creating a New Database

1. **Log in to your hosting control panel** (often called cPanel, Plesk, or similar)
2. **Find the database section** - Look for icons labeled "MySQL Databases," "Database Manager," or similar
3. **Create a new database**:

1. Enter a name for your database (for example: `link_shortener`)
2. Write down this name - you'll need it later!
3. Click "Create Database" or "Next"





### Creating a Database User

1. In the same database section, look for "MySQL Users" or "Add New User"
2. Create a new user:

1. Enter a username (for example: `link_user`)
2. Create a strong password (and save it somewhere safe!)
3. Click "Create User" or "Add User"





### Connecting the User to the Database

1. Look for "Add User to Database" or similar option
2. Select your new user and database from dropdown menus
3. For permissions, select "All Privileges" or check all boxes
4. Click "Add" or "Save"


### Importing the Database Structure

1. In your hosting control panel, find "phpMyAdmin" (usually in the database section)
2. Click on your new database name in the left sidebar
3. Click the "Import" tab at the top
4. Click "Choose File" and select the `db_setup.sql` file from your computer
5. Scroll down and click "Go" or "Import"


## 2. Uploading Your Files

### Preparing Your Files

1. Make sure you have all the files from the code I provided
2. Check that the `config.php` file has been updated with your database information:

1. Open `config.php` in a text editor (like Notepad or TextEdit)
2. Change these lines to match your database information:

```php
$host = 'localhost'; // Usually stays as 'localhost'
$dbname = 'link_shortener'; // The database name you created
$username = 'link_user'; // The username you created
$password = 'your_password'; // The password you created
```


3. Save the file





### Uploading to Your Hosting

1. In your hosting control panel, find "File Manager" or "FTP"
2. Navigate to your website's main folder (often called "public_html," "www," or "htdocs")
3. If you want the link shortener to be your main website:

1. Upload all files directly to this main folder



4. If you want it in a subfolder (like yourdomain.com/links):

1. Create a new folder (e.g., "links")
2. Open that folder
3. Upload all files there





### Using File Manager to Upload

1. Click "Upload" in your file manager
2. Select all the files from your computer
3. Wait for the upload to complete
4. Make sure the folder structure is maintained:

1. All PHP files should be in the locations shown in the code
2. The `api` folder should contain all the API files





## 3. Setting Permissions

This step ensures the web server can read your files:

1. In your file manager, select all the files you uploaded
2. Look for "Permissions," "File Permissions," or a similar option (sometimes it's under "Right-click" menu)
3. Set permissions to:

1. For folders: 755 (this is often shown as checkboxes)
2. For files: 644



4. Click "Apply" or "Save"


## 4. Testing Your Link Shortener

Now it's time to see if everything works:

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to your website address where you installed the link shortener

1. If you installed in the main folder: `http://yourdomain.com`
2. If you installed in a subfolder: `http://yourdomain.com/subfolder`



3. You should see the link shortener interface
4. Test creating a short link:

1. Enter a long URL (like `https://www.google.com`)
2. Click "Create Short Link"
3. You should see a new short URL



5. Test the short link by clicking on it
6. Test editing a link:

1. Enter the short URL you just created
2. Enter a new destination URL
3. Click "Update Link"
4. Test the short link again to see if it redirects to the new URL





## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If something isn't working:

### Database Connection Problems

- Double-check your database name, username, and password in `config.php`
- Make sure the user has permission to access the database


### 500 Server Error

- This usually means there's a PHP error
- Check that all files were uploaded correctly
- Make sure your hosting supports PHP version 7.0 or higher


### Short Links Not Working

- Make sure the `.htaccess` file was uploaded to the main folder
- Check if your hosting supports .htaccess files (most do)
- Some hosts require you to enable "mod_rewrite" - contact your hosting support if needed


### Need More Help?

- Most hosting providers offer support through chat or tickets
- You can show them this guide and ask for help with the specific step you're stuck on


That's it! Your link shortener should now be fully functional. If you have any questions or run into issues, feel free to ask for more help!
